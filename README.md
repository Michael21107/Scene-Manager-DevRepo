#Scene Manager

##INSTALLATION
Drag and drop the included GTA V folder into where your GTA V is installed.

##HOW-TO USE
###Creating Paths:
1.  To create paths, open the Scene Manager menu by pressing Left Shift + T (default) while on foot.  Select "Traffic Menu," then "Create New Path."  
2.  In the Path Creation menu, you can choose different waypoint types and speeds, as well as add and remove waypoints.  The settings for each waypoint are how the AI will drive to THAT waypoint from the PREVIOUS waypoint.
3.  Adding a waypoint will create a waypoint at your player's position.
4.  As you add and remove waypoints, blips will appear and disappear from the game map.  Blips are numbered to correspond with their path.  Blips are also colored to designate the following:  Orange blips are the beginning of a path, red blips are the end of a path, and yellow blips are waypoints between the first and last waypoint.
5.  The path will activate once you select "End path creation," and cars will automatically follow the path when they are close to the first waypoint.
6.  After creating paths, you can delete them via the Traffic Menu.
7.  There is a "Direct nearest driver to path" option in the Traffic Menu which allows you to manually direct the nearest vehicle to a path of your choice.  This option can be buggy when you are on-duty, as LSPDFR interferes.  Directing a driver works better the closer you are to desired path.
8.  The "Dismiss nearest driver" option in the Traffic Menu allows you to dismiss vehicles at "Stop" waypoints.  This option can also be used to try and get vehicles unstuck from precarious situations.
9.  Paths and cones will remain in the world after you die.  Be sure to delete them when you're done!

###Cones Management:
1.  To place cones, open the Scene Manager menu by pressing T (default).
2.  In the Cone Menu, you may scroll through different types of road cones, as well as place and remove cones.
3.  For easier and more accurate cone placement, use the first persion view.
4.  The AI will not drive around cones on their own.  Place cones around your custom paths for maximum immersion.
